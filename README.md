# Microsoft New Movie Studio

## Project Overview

Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio. They have hired me to help them better understand the movie industry and make sound decisions based on Analysis and Science.

To get started, I was given 11 sets of data obtained from the following sources:

    Box Office Mojo

    IMDB

    Rotten Tomatoes

    TheMovieDB

    The Numbers

I was assigned with the following tasks:

Explore the given data and/or find complementary data

Obtain meaningful, actionable insights from it that will

Help the new head of the studio decide what type of films to create

### Business Problem



Business Problem

The problem statement stated is that Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Here I was able to come with three questions that led me to my objectives which included:

    What type of films are currently being produced? which led me directly to the 'Genres'
    What is the budget/income used to produce movies?
    What category/genre of movies is being produced the most in the movie industry?
    
### The Data

The project used three datasets to come up with the following project analysis. The data used include:
bom.movie_gross

this data contained five columns which contained details about the title, studio, domestic gross , foreign gross and year in which the movies started.
imdb.title.ratings

The data had 73856 rows and 3 columns This data had the following information about the movies: tconst.
averagerating - This is how the audience were rating the movies. Scale used was scale 0 to 10
numvotes - This were the number of votes that each movies earned.
imdb.title.basics
The dataset has 146144 rows and 6 columns. The columns in the dataset contained information about the following: tconst
primary_title
original_title
start_year
runtime_minutes
genres

###Results

From the above results on the bar graph plot created we can very well see that Drama Movies are the most produced shows in the movie industry followed by Documentaries and then comedy shows as well. We can as well see that the least produced shows with almost the same frequency is Drama Romance, Comedy Romance and Comedy Drama Romance.

The above pie chart represents the percentages of the top ten movie genres produced in the move industry.

We observe that Drama movie genre is the most produced film in the movie industry as shown in the above pie chart which is represented by 30.1%.

The second most produced shows in the movie industry is Documentary represented by 28.8% and the third being Comedy represented by 13.9%

Movies like comedy, drama, romance are ranked in the 9th position as they are the least produced movies in the movie industry.

Therefore, I can make the conclusion that movie producers like producing single genres of movies other than mixing them up.

From the line plot above we can carefully observe that the annual domestic income increased from 2010 to 2011.

We can also see that from 2011 to 2014 the domestic gross started decreasing.

There was an increase in the domestic gross from 2014 to 2015 then the gross started declining from 2015 to 2016.

The domestic gross continued to decline from 2016 to 2017 then an increase was observed from 2017 to 2018.

As we can see from the line plot above for the foreign gross there was an increase in the foreign gross from 2010 to 2012.

From 2012 to 2014 the foreign gross income started to decline.

Additionally, from 2014 to 2015 the foreign gross increased again which showed a positive outcome.

From 2015 all through 2018 the foreign gross income declined drastically.

###Coclusion & Recommendation

As we can see from the above Data Analysis we have gotten the chance to analyse movies produced in the industry, income used, their ratings and the genres mostly produced.

From the observation made based on the analysis done we have seen that Drama movies are the most produced movies in the movies industry with a percentage of 30.1%.

Another observation made is that Documentary and Comedy movies are the second and third most produced films in different countries respectively with 28.8% and 13.9% percentage.

The domestic gross and foreign gross income chnage over time as they increase and decrease over time hence they are not consistent.

From a business perspective, I would urge the Microsoft shareholders to produce movies more in the Drama genres, Documentary or Comedy as they are the top three most produced movies.

I advise this because if I was to count the total percentage that these three genres contribute to the movie industry it amounts to a total of 72.8% which is a positive outcome.

In conclusion, Microsoft should think of targeting both domestic and foreign markets as thye are both competitive moreover, assessing the risk it may bring to the business.
